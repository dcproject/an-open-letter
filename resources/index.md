Polemic writings on points of truths. Whereas the other resources on this site generally present purely positive affirmations of scriptural truths, the articles in this category generally take criticisms or deviations from those truths as starting points. Many of these are from the Web site <http://contendingforthefaith.org>, a site operated by the Defense &amp; Confirmation Project (DCP).
