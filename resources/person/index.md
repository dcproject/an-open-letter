# THE PERSON OF CHRIST

## BOOKS:

In Concerning the Person of Christ Witness Lee describes the different schools of Christology throughout the Christian era and reviews the record of both the Old and New Testaments concerning the Person of Christ with particular emphasis on His being one person with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.

Other books by Witness Lee that open up the riches of the biblical revelation concerning Christ:

* The All-Inclusive Christ is the first conference Witness Lee gave in the United States in 1962. In it Witness Lee shows how the good land of Canaan is a type of Christ for the believers to enter into and possess for the building of God’s habitation.

* In Christ in His Excellency Witness Lee speaks of the supreme preciousness of Christ, His transcendence, His glory, His riches, and His fullness.

* The Wonderful Being of Christ shows that Christ is both God and man, the Redeemer and the Savior, life and resurrection, the life-giving Spirit, and everything to the church.

## AFFIRMATION & CRITIQUE (A&C):

The April 1997 issue of A&C (II:2) is on the subject of “The All-Inclusive Christ.” In this issue “Christ Is Everything,” by Ron Kangas, presents the all-inclusive Christ as the center of the Bible, the complete God, and many other items.

In the October 1998 issue of A&C (III:4) (“Christ Reconsidered“), “Christological Errors: Then and Now,” by Gary Evans, examines eight Christological errors, their main proponents, the scriptural antidote for each error, and their modern reemergences.

## RADIO BROADCASTS:

* In “Christ: The Preeminent and All-Inclusive One, The Centrality and Universality Of God” (Colossians, program 5) Witness Lee shows that in God’s economy Christ is both preeminent and all-inclusive, that is, that He has the first place in all things and that He is everything.

* In “The Son” (Hebrews, program 3) Witness Lee explains how, in both His person and His work, Christ is the very speaking of God, that is, that everything He is and everything He does speaks forth God.

## POLEMIC WRITINGS:

* “The Error of Denying That the Infinite God Became a Finite Man through Incarnation” examines the objection of a well-known apologist who claims that it is wrong to say that God became man in Jesus Christ.

* “Scholars Who Affirm That the Infinite God Became a Finite Man” presents statements from prominent Christian scholars who affirm that God became a man in Jesus Christ.
