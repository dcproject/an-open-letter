# THE WORK OF CHRIST

## BOOKS:

* The Conclusion of the New Testament, Messages 63-78 presents a panoramic view of the work of Christ, including creation, His incarnation, His human living, His earthly ministry, His death, His burial, His resurrection, His ascension, His heavenly ministry, His ruling in the divine administration, His coming back, and His work in the millennium, after the millennium, andin eternity future in the New Jerusalem.

* The Four Major Steps of Christ gives a brief sketch of Christ’s accomplishments in His work of incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension.

* The Heavenly Ministry of Christ focuses on what Christ is doing in the present age in His heavenly ministry, including His work as Lord and Ruler, as the Head of the Body, as the Executor of the new covenant, and as our High Priest in the heavens.

## AFFIRMATION & CRITIQUE (A&C):

The July 1997 issue of Affirmation & Critique (II:3) is titled “The Processes of the All-inclusive Christ.” The following articles in this issue examine the steps in the accomplishment of Christ’s work:

* “The Incarnation and Human Living of the All-inclusive Christ," by John Campbell, presents the incarnated God-man, Jesus Christ, in seven designations and examines His human living to manifest the Father.

* “The All-inclusive Death of Christ,” by Witness Lee, identifies crucial aspects of the all-inclusive death of the God-man, including the shedding of His blood, His being forsaken by God economically, and His sevenfold status in His death on the cross, paying particular attention to the significance of the blood and water which came from His side (John 19:34).

* “The Significance and Application of the Resurrection of Christ," by John Pester, critiques the popular tendency to treat the resurrection in terms of its historicity and objective significance rather than in terms of the intrinsic significance of resurrection and its application to the believers.

* “The Ministry of Christ in His Ascension," by Witness Lee, reviews the biblical record of the statuses into which Christ was inaugurated after His ascension and sixteen aspects of what He is doing today in His heavenly ministry.

## RADIO BROADCASTS:

* In “The Incarnation of the Man-Savior Fulfilling the Purpose of God in His Creation of Man” (Luke, program 51), Witness Lee links Christ’s incarnation with God’s eternal purpose to be man’s life and content so that man could be His expression and representation.

* In “Judged, Crucified, and Buried” (Matthew, program 72) Witness Lee gives a vivid portrayal of the time Christ spent on the cross and its division into two sections—the first section, in which He suffered the mocking and blaspheming of men and the second in which He was forsaken by God while being judged as sin on our behalf.

* In “The King’s Victory” (Matthew, program 74) Witness Lee speaks of the resurrection of Christ as the demonstration of God’s righteousness in justifying not only His Son but also all His believers based upon the death of Christ. He also presents Christ’s charge to His disciples to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God.

* “The Heavenly Ministry of the Heavenly Christ” (Hebrews, program 31) gives a sketch of the work of Christ in His heavenly ministry as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. It also describes the turn in the book of Hebrews to call the believers to “come forward to the Holy of Holies.”
