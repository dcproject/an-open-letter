# SALVATION

## BOOKS:

* [God’s Salvation in Life](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=US3NL0A5VTXPY) covers four major milestones in God’s inward salvation of the believers by being life to them—regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification.

* [Lesson Book, Level 1: Salvation—God’s Full Salvation](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=QPTBN1HYOBNJX) contains a series of lessons on major truths related to God’s full salvation, including His creation of man; man’s fall; the source and basis of God’s salvation; Christ’s redemption; the forgiveness, cleansing, justification, and reconciliation of the believers judicially; and the regeneration, sanctification, transformation, and conformation of the believers in life.

* [The Organic Aspect of God’s Salvation](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=AAGOOQ5DIZLCN) opens up the two aspects of God’s complete salvation—the judicial aspect as the procedure of God’s salvation through the redemption of Christ for God’s salvation to fully meet the righteous requirement of His law, and the organic aspect as the fulfillment of God’s salvation through the life of Christ for the believers to be transformed and to grow and mature in the life of God.

## AFFIRMATION & CRITIQUE (A&C):

Affirmation & Critique (A&C) has published many issues dealing with various aspects of God’s complete salvation. The July 1996 issue of A&C (I:3) is dedicated to the subject of [“Union with the Triune God.”](http://affcrit.com/archives/ac_96_03.html) The following two articles are from that issue:

* [“The Believers’ Union with the Triune God in His Organic Salvation,”](http://affcrit.com/pdfs/1996/03/96_03_a1.pdf) by Ed Marks, presents God’s organic salvation in the steps of regeneration, organic shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, conformation, and glorification.

* [“‘…that we might be made God’,”](http://affcrit.com/pdfs/1996/03/96_03_a3.pdf) by Kerry S. Robichaux, affirms that the early church understood the deification of man to be the goal and result of God’s salvation. It emphasizes the distinction between God’s incommunicable and communicable aspects and defines the proper use and limits of the term deification.

## RADIO BROADCASTS:

Concerning judicial redemption through the death of Christ (Rom. 5:10a):

* In [“Justification in God’s Way”](http://www.lsmradio.com/audio/mp3-files/Romans/Rom_06.mp3) (Romans, program 6) Witness Lee describes how God justifies the believers in Christ through their faith in Christ’s redemptive work.

* [“Righteousness—The Power of the Gospel (1)”](http://www.lsmradio.com/audio/mp3-files/Romans/Rom_57.mp3) (Romans, program 57) is the first of two programs in which Witness Lee expounds [Romans 1:16-17](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4802&lvid=4803), showing that God’s salvation is unshakeable because it is based on God’s righteous judgment of Christ on our behalf.

Concerning God’s salvation in life ([Rom. 5:10b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4913&lvid=4913)):

* [“Salvation in Life from Sin and Worldliness”](http://www.lsmradio.com/audio/mp3-files/Romans/Rom_41.mp3) (Romans, program 41) is the first in a series of programs in which Witness Lee shows how God saves the believers in the life of Christ from many negative things.

* In [“The Life of the Triune God Dispensed into the Tripartite Man”](http://www.lsmradio.com/audio/mp3-files/Romans/Rom_63.mp3) (Romans, program 63) Witness Lee shows how God in His salvation dispenses Himself as life into man’s spirit, soul, and body ([Rom. 8:10](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4982&lvid=4982), [6](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4978&lvid=4978), [11](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4983&lvid=4983)).

* In [“Grace, Salvation, the Spirit and Christ”](http://www.lsmradio.com/audio/mp3-files/Philippians/Phil_32.mp3) (Philippians, program 32) Witness Lee shows that God’s salvation is not limited to eternal salvation but has an aspect for the believers’ experience today that results in Christ being magnified through them ([Phil. 1:7](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6224&lvid=6224), [19-21](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6236&lvid=6238)).
