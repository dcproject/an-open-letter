# THE BIBLE

## BOOKS:

* The Basic Revelation in the Holy Scriptures gives a broad view of seven key subjects in the Bible—God’s plan, Christ’s redemption, the Spirit’s application, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.

* Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer presents how the believers through prayer can enjoy all the riches of God in Christ, His embodiment, as both the Word of God and the Spirit.

* The Full Knowledge of the Word of God explains the need to know the essence of God’s word as the divine breath, the believers’ spiritual milk, the bread of life, the Spirit and life, and Christ (God Himself), as well as some keys to understanding the Bible and some key truths that have been misunderstood.

* On Knowing the Bible consists of messages given to encourage young believers to read the Bible; it discusses what the Bible is, how it came into being, the subject, central thought, and sections of the Bible, and principles of interpreting the Bible.

## AFFIRMATION & CRITIQUE (A&C):

* “About Affirmation & Critique (A&C): Our Perspective” explains the principles which govern the journal’s articles in the presentation of the interpretation of the Bible.

* “The Crystallization: The Key to the Bible” (IV:3, July 1999) presents the economy of God as the basic hermeneutical principle in interpreting the Bible.

## RADIO BROADCASTS:

* In “The General Sketch and Central Thought (1)” (Genesis, program 1) Witness Lee shows that the Bible is a book of life and that the main revelation in the Bible is God’s intention to be life to man.

* In “The Application by Prayer” (Ephesians, program 58) Witness Lee expounds Ephesians 6:17-18, which charges the believers to take the Word of God by means of all prayer and petition.

* In “The Word of Christ Inhabiting Us” (Colossians, program 47) Witness Lee expounds Paul’s charge to the Colossians to “let the word of Christ dwell in you richly” (Col. 3:16).

## POLEMIC WRITINGS:

* “The Error of Making Creeds, Not the Bible, the Rule of Faith” examines some of the deficiencies of the creeds and the importance of taking the Bible as the unique rule of the believers’ faith and practice.
