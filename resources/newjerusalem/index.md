# THE NEW JERUSALEM

## BOOKS:

* [The Conclusion of the New Testament, Messages 254-264](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=OXCARU0067DD2) provides a thorough view of the New Testament record of the New Jerusalem, its place in the Bible, the meaning of its symbols, and its significance for believers today.

* In [God’s New Testament Economy](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=92FACRH9DBZ73), chapters 26-44, Witness Lee shows that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the entire divine revelation in the Scriptures, of the eternal purpose of God, and of the mingling of the Triune God with man, among other things. He then presents the spiritual significance the New Jerusalem’s designations, the basic elements of its structure, and its features, applying all of these symbols to the believers’ experience today.

* [Life-study of Revelation](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=MAL2ZBL6WYYTT), chapters 59-65, first addresses the way to see the vision of the New Jerusalem and then proceeds to look at its designations, its meaning, its features, its furnishings, and its life supply.

## AFFIRMATION & CRITIQUE (A&C):

The April 2000 issue of A&C (V:2) includes an excerpt from Watchman Nee’s book The Glorious Church entitled [“The Holy City, New Jerusalem.”](http://www.affcrit.com/pdfs/2000/02/00_02_a6.pdf) In it he speaks of the New Jerusalem as “a figure, describing the characteristics and spiritual condition of the corporate Body whom God chose before creation,” and he explains the spiritual significance of many of its features.

Ron Kangas contributed an article titled [“The New Jerusalem: The Consummation of the Divine Economy according to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation”](http://www.affcrit.com/pdfs/2010-Fall/10_02_a3.pdf) to the Fall 2010 issue (XV:2) of A&C. In it he shows that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of God’s full salvation, which is shown to be a love story resulting in a blissful union for eternity.
