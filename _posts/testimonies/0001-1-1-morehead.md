For many years various evangelical counter-cult organizations and individuals have contributed helpful warnings to the church in regards to doctrinal teachings and worldviews that are incompatible with Christianity. Along the way various groups have been labeled “cultic” or “heterodox,” and while evangelicals should always be concerned about sound teaching, they should also be open to the reassessment of their views as religious groups change over time, and also in light of the possibility that former assessments may not have been accurate.

In the past serious concerns were expressed about the doctrine of Living Stream Ministry and the local churches. However, with a fresh assessment came new conclusions, and a group of evangelical scholars and ministry professionals have classified Living Stream Ministry as an orthodox group. While some in the evangelical counter-cult community may disagree, they are not the only viable voice in evangelicalism on such matters.

In fact, in recent years an internal critique has taken place in regards to counter-cult methodology. There are concerns that its weaknesses in analysis, in terms of its emphasis on worldview definition and boundary maintenance via apologetics, can at times lead to misunderstandings of various new religious movements and minority religions.

For these reasons, those considering Living Stream Ministry are encouraged to listen to the organization and its members on their own terms as they understand themselves through their doctrinal formulations and other articulations of their faith and practice. When this is done, the inquirer will have a rewarding experience in their encounter with the members of the local churches and Living Stream Ministry.
